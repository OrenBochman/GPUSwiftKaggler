This repository contains Apple playgrounds and full Xcode projects for running compute kernels on an apple GPU instance.
In particular each lesson describes a different topic while building knwoledge from previous lessons. 

**Dreaming about writing an ML based app for the iPhone?** Want to get your hands dirty writing basic image processing filters using Swift Plygrounds ... on the GPU using Metal? 

You are in the right place. 

Apple's Metal is a low-level, low-overhead hardware-accelerated graphics API that debuted in iOS 8. Apple states that Metal "lets developers create highly immersive console-style games on iPhone. Metal is optimized to allow the CPU and GPU to work together to deliver detailed graphics and complex visual eﬀects." 

Apple had also recently presented a native machine learning (CoreML) and machine vision (Vision) frameworks augmenting the already existing libraries they provided (e.g, Accelerate). This significantly enhances the vast array of ML based apps that can be deployed to IOS based devices.
