**WORK IN PROGRESS*

# A Swift/Metal based library for IOS/OSX GPU based Machine and Deep Learning for Kaggle.
![Swift 3.0 compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift-3.0-orange.svg)

## Introduction

**GPUSwiftKaggler** contains Apple playgrounds and full Xcode projects for running compute kernels on an apple GPU instance targeting mostly *Kaggle competitions*. Many frameworks have been incorporated into this to make it easier to get you going.

**AFAIK, GPUSwiftKaggler is the first Swift based library for Kaggle.** 

# Dependencies

- `Accelerate` framework
- `Foundation` framework
- `Metal` framework
- `MPS (Metal Performance Shaders)` framework
- `HDF5KIT` framework
- `MetalACC` framework

## Features
- [x] Very fast: uses Metal and Accelerate under the hood which leaverages the GPU and SIMD of the CPU, which make the code run faster than native Swift code.
- [x] Extensible image processing for feature generation.

## Motivation 
**Dreaming about writing an ML based app for the iPhone?** Want to get your hands dirty in a Kaggle competition? Want to use the GPU with Metal? 
You are in the right place. 

## Bakcground 
**Apple's Metal** is a low-level, low-overhead hardware-accelerated graphics API that debuted in iOS 8. Apple states that Metal "lets developers create highly immersive console-style games on iPhone. Metal is optimized to allow the CPU and GPU to work together to deliver detailed graphics and complex visual eï¬€ects."

Apple had also recently presented a native machine learning (**CoreML**) and machine vision (**Vision**) frameworks augmenting the already existing libraries they provided (e.g, Accelerate). This significantly enhances the vast array of ML based apps that can be deployed to IOS based devices.

## Usage

This example shows how to use an existing Kaggle Data set.
```swift
import HDF5Kit
import Metal 
import Accelerate
import GPUSwiftKaggler
```
